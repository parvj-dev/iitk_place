<strong>Company overview:</strong><br>
Google is not a conventional company, and we don&#x2019;t intend to become one. True, we share attributes with the world&#x2019;s most successful organizations &#x2013; a focus on innovation and smart business practices comes to mind &#x2013; but even as we continue to grow, we&#x2019;re committed to retaining a small-company feel. At Google,<br>
we know that every employee has something important to say, and that every employee is integral to our success. We provide individually-tailored compensation packages that can be comprised of competitive salary, bonus, and equity components, along with the opportunity to earn further financial bonuses and rewards. Googlers thrive in small, focused teams and high-energy environments, believe in the ability of technology to change the world, and are as passionate about their lives as they are about their work.

<strong>The areas:<br>
Engineering &amp; Operations:</strong> Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with a broad set of technical skills who are ready to tackle some of technology&apos;s greatest challenges and make an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they<br>
routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new platforms for developers around the world. From AdWords to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another. Engineering Productivity: As a software engineer in the Engineering Productivity organization, you&apos;ll use your software design, analysis and programming skills to create innovative automated test systems. This isn&apos;t a job in which you&apos;ll simply debug and run test cases; in fact that only scratches the surface. The<br>
test team undertakes a broad range of challenges on a daily basis, designing and building intelligent systems that can explore various use cases and scenarios for distributed computing infrastructure. Just imagine trying to design and build an automated testing system for something that&apos;s never been done<br>
before. There are no textbooks that can help you learn this, which is why we have some of the best and brightest engineers working in this group.<br>
<strong>The role:</strong><br>
Google&apos;s software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how millions of users connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our ambitions reach far beyond just Search. Our products need to handle information at the scale of the web. We&apos;re looking for ideas from<br>
every area of computer science, including information retrieval, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking, security, data compression, and user interface design; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you work on<br>
a small team and can switch teams and projects as our fast-paced business grows and evolves. We need our engineers to be versatile and passionate to tackle new problems as we continue to push technology forward. As a key member of a small and versatile team, you design, test, deploy and maintain software solutions.<br>
<strong>Responsibilities:</strong><br>
&#x25CF; Research, conceive and develop software applications to extend and improve on Google&apos;s product offering.<br>
&#x25CF; Contribute to a wide variety of projects utilising natural language processing, artificial intelligence, data compression, machine learning and search&#xA0; technologies.<br>
&#x25CF; Collaborate on scalability issues involving access to massive amounts of data and information.<br>
&#x25CF; Solve all problems that come your way.<br>
<strong>Minimum qualifications:</strong><br>
&#x25CF; BS/ MS or equivalent practical experience.<br>
&#x25CF; Experience with Unix/Linux or Windows and/or Mac environments, distributed systems, machine learning, information retrieval and TCP/IP.<br>
&#x25CF; Experience programming in C, C++, Java and/or Python.</p> </td>
