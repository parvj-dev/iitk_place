&#xA0;<br>
Safe food for a billion people. That&#x2019;s our mission at Ninjacart. We&#x2019;re working on one of the hardest supply chain problems, globally - the journey of the food we eat - from farmers all the way to the retailers who sell to us. The $168bn market in India - where nearly 96% of the market is in unorganized general trade - operates through local mandis and numerous middlemen. That&#x2019;s where we come in: by eliminating the middlemen and taking ownership of the entire value chain, we ensure greater value for our producers and our customers.&#xA0;<br>
&#xA0;<br>
It&#x2019;s a win-win for all our stakeholders: &#xB7; We help farmers get better prices and deal with consistent demand - we&#x2019;re literally saving lives (farmer suicides are rampant in various parts of India) &#xB7; We help retailers source vegetables at lower costs, ensuring freshness through highly efficient ops &#xB7; We&#x2019;re reducing food wastage across the supply chain, saving the world in the process &#xB7; Last but far from least - we&#x2019;re ensuring that all of us get fresher vegetables and fruits from the markets, for a better life for people in India&#xA0;<br>
&#xA0;<br>
How do we do it?&#xA0;<br>
&#xA0;<br>
We do this effectively at lower cost, better speed and larger scale using integrated supply chain powered by technology, analytics, infrastructure and logistics network.&#xA0;<br>
&#xA0;<br>
We move 600 Tonnes of produce from farmers to retailers in less than 12 hours every day! We work with 12,000+ farmers and 17,000+ retailers every month. We had been previously been operating out of Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad. In the last 4 months we have launched in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad, and have doubled our volumes. For our next phase of (hyper)growth, we plan to scale up to 20+ cities across India.&#xA0;<br>
&#xA0;<br>
In a short span of 3.5+ years, we have garnered support from various stakeholders who believe in our mission and stand by us. We have recently raised $100 million (Series C) which has been one of the largest investments by Tiger Global, which is the solo largest best in an Indian Startup ever by the New-York based firm. Our investors include Accel US, Syngenta Ventures, Jo Hirao, Founder of ZIGExN, Neoplux, HR Capital and Trifecta Capital, Accel India, Nandan Nilekani, Mistletoe and Qualcomm Ventures.&#xA0;<br>

About GET:&#xA0;<br>
&#xA0;<br>
With the pace that we operate at, and the niche and typical industry that we function in, we realized that there is a dearth of talent with the right kind of drive. Finding the right kind of people becomes an operational challenge. And hence, with GET, we have decided to home-grow talent and help them scale to be executors at our fast growing organization.&#xA0;<br>
